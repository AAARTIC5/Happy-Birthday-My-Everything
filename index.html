                    <!-- EDIT THIS TEXT TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR LETTER -->
                    <p>Since you entered my life, something inside me truly changed. My heart became softer, more honest, and filled with feelings I never knew how to express before. You made me better without even trying — simply by being you, through your presence and the quiet beauty you brought into my world. 🎉</p>
                    <p>My Maather, since knowing you, I’ve been full of emotions that words can hardly contain. You live in my thoughts, in my prayers, and in the smallest details of my days. You gave life a different meaning, a warmer and more sincere one, and being close to you feels like peace.</p>
                    <p>You are the most beautiful ending to this year, and the most beautiful part of it. I look forward to many years ahead with you — growing together, sharing life step by step, and supporting each other through everything that comes our way.✨</p>
                    <p>My Maather, I am deeply grateful for your presence in my life. Thank you for every feeling you awakened in me, for every quiet smile you gave me without realizing it. You are a true blessing, and a place my heart will always choose. 💖</p>
                    <p>With all my love,</p>
                    <p class="signature">Your Love Mortada 💝</p>
